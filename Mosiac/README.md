# Moscaic 

This sketch takes in an image, creates a smaller version. The smaller version of the image is then enlarged, creating pixelated effect. Pixels are replaced with squares with approximate color of the enlarged pixel. Depending on the brightness of the pixel, the square will either be inset or extruded.
